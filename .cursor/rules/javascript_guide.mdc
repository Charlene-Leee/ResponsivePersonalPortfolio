# JavaScript Guide

The main custom JavaScript logic for the website is in [assets/js/main.js](mdc:assets/js/main.js). This script manages all major interactive features of the site:

*   **Menu Interaction:**
    *   Shows/hides the mobile navigation menu (`#nav-menu`) using `#nav-toggle` and `#nav-close` buttons.
    *   Removes the mobile menu when a `.nav__link` is clicked.
*   **Accordion for Skills:**
    *   Toggles the visibility of skill details (`skills__content`) when a `.skills__header` is clicked, managing `skills__open` and `skills__close` classes.
*   **Tabs for Qualification:**
    *   Switches between Education and Work tabs by managing `qualification__active` class on `[data-target]` buttons and `[data-content]` divs.
*   **Services Modal:**
    *   Opens and closes modal windows (`.services__modal`) for service details, triggered by `.services__button` and closed by `.services__modal-close`.
*   **Portfolio Swiper:**
    *   Initializes Swiper for the `.portfolio__container` with navigation buttons and pagination.
*   **Testimonial Swiper:**
    *   Initializes Swiper for the `.testimonial__container` with pagination, loop, and responsive settings.
*   **Scroll-based Interactions:**
    *   **Active Navigation Link:** Adds `active-link` class to the corresponding navigation link when a section scrolls into view.
    *   **Change Header Background:** Adds `scroll-header` class to the header (`#header`) when scrolling down.
    *   **Show Scroll-Up Button:** Adds `show-scroll` class to the scroll-up button (`#scroll-up`) when scrolling past a certain point.
*   **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:**
    *   Toggles `dark-theme` class on `document.body` and icon class (`uil-sun`/`uil-moon`) on `#theme-button`.
    *   Saves and retrieves the user's theme preference using `localStorage` (`selected-theme`, `selected-icon`).

The project also links to [assets/js/swiper-bundle.min.js](mdc:assets/js/swiper-bundle.min.js) which provides the Swiper library functionality used by `main.js`.

When developing, ensure that [index.html](mdc:index.html) correctly links to all necessary JavaScript files.
