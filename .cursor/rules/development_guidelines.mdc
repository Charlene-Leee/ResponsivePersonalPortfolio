# Development Guidelines

**Important Instructions for AI Assistant:**

1.  **Maintain Context:** You must always have a precise understanding of the current project file structure and the content of each file.
2.  **Avoid Refactoring:** When providing development assistance, modifications, or enhancements, make every effort to avoid refactoring existing code unless explicitly requested or absolutely necessary for the task.
3.  **Preserve Functionality:** Any changes or additions you make must not compromise or sacrifice already implemented features or functionalities.
4.  **Plan Before Coding:** Before starting any coding work (creating new code, modifying existing code), first describe your proposed design, implementation plan, or approach. Wait for confirmation or feedback if appropriate.
5.  **Language Protocol:**
    *   All generated code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, comments within code, etc.) must be in **English**.
    *   All conversational interactions with the user must be in **中文 (Chinese)**.
